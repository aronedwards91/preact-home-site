          [b] Give Honest & sincere appreciation (Humans desire flattery & appreciation, applied truthfully & honestly gives it credence & power).

          [c] Work to remember names (The show of importance you have taken in doing so will greatly endear others to you).
          [d] Be an active listener, encourage others to tell you about themselves (Truly listening to another is one of the highest compliments that can be paid).
          [e] Talk in terms of another’s interest (If you know what another treasures most, then you know what topics they will be most responsive to).

          [b] Show respect for the opinions of others (No one takes the dismissal of their opinions well, and there can be no constructive conversation without respect).
          [c] Have the courage to be the first to admit one’s errors, quickly & emphatically.
          [d] Begin in a friendly way (The starting mood of a conversation defines the path it takes).
          [e] Start by getting a yes (Find places of agreement & display understanding to begin the conversation of sound footing).
          [f] Let the other person do the most talking (Ideas spread once someone convinces themselves, not when an idea is forced upon them, let someone else break down their understanding for you).
          [g] Let the other person feel the idea is theirs (As above, give someone the space to come to the final conclusion by their own logic).
          [h] Try honestly to look from another’s view (Without honest interest & understanding, or at least the attempt, you will be unable to frame an idea that fits within their perspective).
          [i] Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas & point of view (Human’s hunger for sympathy, if you can sympathise your can then design & frame your words to provide sincere help).

          [c] Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person (Taking your share of responsibility will make others more likely to shoulder theirs).
          [d] Ask questions instead of giving orders (Learn the other’s insights and allow them to take part ownership in the next course of action).
          [e] Let others save face (Do not chastise & humiliate in front of others, the human shame response is painful and unproductive).
          [f] Praise every improvement (Reward growth, praise is coveted by everyone).
          [g] Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to (People will live up to, or down to what is expected of them). 
          [h] Use encouragement, make faults seem easy to correct (Step an action into parts so progress is visibly within reach).

        text: `A powerful indicator of business success.
        Heavily linked to body language.
        Not ‘always on’.
        Charismatic people are seen as powerful, strong presence and as having strong interest in people (warmth).
        Warmth comes from goodwill, caring.
        Underlined by presence (not attractiveness).
        Increased by exercise.
        What your mind believes, your body manifests.
        Four types of charisma;
        [1] Focus Charisma: (Presence), communicating a respect for other’s opinions.
        [2] Visionary Charisma: (Belief) inspires other’s with your conviction, radiates acceptance, not criticism.
        [3] Authority Charisma: (Status) suggests power, importance. dis-invites feedback.
        [4] Kindness Charisma: (Warmth) Suggests acceptance, promotes emotional bond. 
        People most strongly remember first & last.
        Envy prevention; JAIR, Justify, Appreciate other’s actions, define their Impact, give other’s Responsibility.`

        Reduced nodding.
        Pauses.
        Not distracted (strongly visible in body language).
        Increase concentration on those talking.
        Mental state reflected by body (anxiety, dissatisfaction, self-doubt, internal negativity).
        Facial expressions are universal
        First impressions can define whole relationship.
        Strong handshake imparts large impression, very important.
        Good handshake: stand straight, no hands in pockets, strong eye contact, straight head, shake from elbow, extend to display warmth.
        When leaving a conversion, offer value (Information, connection, recognition), people remember feelings more than words.
        Good listening: Never interrupt, pause before reply, let facial expression respond, then follow with words.
        Charismatic speaking: Highlight the good, fully absorb and appreciate compliments, don’t try to impress, let others impress you, be graphic in explanations, trigger good emotions after listening (entertainment, information, laughter)
        Vocal intonation: Lower baritone is more impactful, modulate volume to empower certain words, slow tempo, frequent pauses.
        Smiling adds warmth to words, even over the phone.
        Sitting next to someone reduces confrontational emotions more than face to face.
        Intense eye contact can produce a powerful impact.
        Posture highlights many internal emotions.
        Turn on Confident body language: breath calmly, stand up, shake body, take a wide stance, stretch arms to ceiling, stretch arms to side, bring arms to side, roll shoulder, inflate (take up space).
        Fidgeting, nodding and excess movement communicate, ‘low-status’.
        Avoid anger.
        Structure bad news, depersonalise (behaviour > person), be specific, empathise.
        Fight defensiveness of others by bringing up past positives, impart goodwill.
        Apologies; first forgive yourself, listen to all the other has to say, do not interrupt, use I’m sorry above sorry, show understanding of action’s effects.
        Never multitask on phone calls.
        Counteract shame in others, empathise, share, show appreciation.
        When in the spotlight; Accept, show vulnerability, show emotions, mention any nervousness.`

        title: "Charisma Mentality",
        text: `Dissatisfaction caused by comparison
        Self-criticism causes internal threat response, reducing brain power.
        Gratitude helps feeling of contentment, which aids charisma.
        A feeling of general goodwill to others is visible through body language.
        Compassion comes from goodwill plus empathy.
        Empathy => Sympathy => Compassion
        Self-confidence: Belief in ability.
        Self-esteem: How much we value ourselves as a person.
        Self-compassion: How much warmth we have for ourselves.
        It is healthier to focus on self-compassion, than self-esteem, this allows you to still care for yourself even when you do wrong, thus helping you resolve mistakes & inaction.
        When down, self-compassion is an important mental activity to help heal.
        Your body language can change your mood, smiling, excited movement, a powerful stance, all feed back to your mind as you feed back to your body.
        Logic makes you think, emotion makes you act.
        Emotions are contagious.
        Mirroring body language can grow connection.`

        Imagine troubles lifted from you, ‘you no longer control the outcome’, let go of belief of control.
        
        [2] De-stigmatise discomfort
        Reiterate it’s natural banality, it’s an everyday occurrence.
        Understand no ‘right way’ of feeling, examine feelings as information about you, emotions are an evolutionary by-product.
        Decry shame, the most mentally destructive response.
        Remind self, it’s a burden shared by many.

        [4] Neutralise Negativity

        Label thoughts, what is such a thoughts psychological cause.
        Depersonalise yourself as a human case-study.
        Look down from space, minimise issues importance.

        Analyse anxiety, find good, even if unrealistic.
        Note down alternative perspective.
        For personal aggrievement, write an exchange of feeling filled letters, do not send.
        Will this matter in a month.
        Change your environment, play calm music.
        
        [6] Delve in to discomfort 
        Practice uncomfortable situations to inoculate, with friend partner.
        Hold eye contact for longer that socially acceptable.

        Resist urge to relive discomfort, tension.
